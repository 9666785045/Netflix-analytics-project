# Netflix-analytics-project
Python-based exploratory data analysis on Netflix titles dataset with visual insights on content types, ratings, genres, and global trends.

## Introduction of project
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix’s global content library using Python.
The goal is to uncover patterns in Netflix’s catalog, including:

Movies vs TV Shows distribution

Top content-producing countries

Release trends over the years

Ratings distribution (TV-MA, TV-14, etc.)

Most common genres on Netflix

The analysis uses pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and involves data cleaning, feature extraction, and generating multiple insightful visualizations.
This project demonstrates strong skills in Python data analysis and data-driven storytelling.
