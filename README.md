# Netflix-analytics-project
Python-based exploratory data analysis on Netflix titles dataset with visual insights on content types, ratings, genres, and global trends.

## Introduction of project
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix’s global content library using Python.
The goal is to uncover patterns in Netflix’s catalog, including:

Movies vs TV Shows distribution

Top content-producing countries

Release trends over the years

Ratings distribution (TV-MA, TV-14, etc.)

Most common genres on Netflix

The analysis uses pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and involves data cleaning, feature extraction, and generating multiple insightful visualizations.
This project demonstrates strong skills in Python data analysis and data-driven storytelling.

seaborn – styled charts
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – analysis environment

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

According to your report and code:
Missing values were inspected and cleaned
Duplicate rows were removed
Country, rating, genres, and release year fields were corrected
Genres were split into lists for counting (from listed_in column)
Dataset structure and data types were inspected before visualization

## Visualizations & Insights

Followed by TV-14, TV-PG, and R

Suggests Netflix focuses heavily on mature audiences

5️⃣ Top 10 Most Common Genres

International Movies

Dramas

Comedies are the top genres, showing user demand for global and diverse content.

## Conclusion
The Netflix Data Analysis project uncovers significant patterns in Netflix’s global content library using Python-based exploratory data analysis. Through detailed visualizations and statistical exploration, the analysis reveals that Netflix offers far more movies than TV shows, with the United States and India dominating content production. Ratings distribution highlights a focus on mature audiences, while genre analysis shows strong popularity in international movies, dramas, and comedies. The release-year trend confirms substantial growth in Netflix content after 2015.
